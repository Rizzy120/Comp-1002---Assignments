                <H1>Atari 2600 (1982-1985)</H1>
                <p>This model was introduced in 1982 and was the first to use "2600" in its name (the previous models all being officially named the "Video Computer System"). Besides containing a different logo than earlier models, this model does not have woodgrain on the front and is primarily black, resulting in the nickname of “Darth Vader” model, due to its all-black appearance and lack of wood grain. Atari also officially rebranded the system as the "Atari 2600" with this variant, attempting to give the console a family look with the recently released Atari 5200. Outside of this visual difference, the "Vader" models are largely identical to the previous wood grain variant. Despite a corporate switchover during 1984, these continued to be manufactured into 1985.</p>

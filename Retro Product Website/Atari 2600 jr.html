                <H1>Atari 2600 Jr. (1984-1992)</H1>
                <p>The 2600 Jr. is a smaller, more compact version of the original Atari 2600, released in 1984 in Europe and globally in 1986. Despite its redesign, it retains the same functionality as the four-switch models. This version is often referred to as the "2600 Jr." because of its reduced size and thinner form factor, along with a distinctive faceplate, typically made of aluminum. The early Jr. models have a faceplate with embossed "Atari 2600" text and a small rainbow underneath it, similar in style to the Atari 5200's faceplate. After 1986, the faceplate was modified to feature an embossed Atari logo and a silkscreened rainbow that spans its entire length.

                    Although it retains its functionality, the Jr. models are known for poorer reliability. Atari switched to using a mylar flex circuit for the Select and Reset buttons, which tends to oxidize and become non-responsive over time. This issue often requires the replacement or modification of the console to use tact switches instead.
                    
                    An early all-black variant exists, which was manufactured in Ireland and sold exclusively in Europe. This version is largely cosmetic, with no significant changes in functionality.
                    
                    The 2600 Jr. follows Atariâ€™s long-standing partnership with Sears, which began in 1975 with the release of the original Pong console. This collaboration continued as various models of the Atari VCS (Video Computer System) were marketed as the Sears Video Arcade series, starting in 1977. The final model released specifically under the Sears name was the Video Arcade II, which came out in the fall of 1982.
                    
                    Additionally, Sears sold versions of Atari games branded under the Tele-Games label, often with altered titles. Atari also developed three exclusive games for Sears: Steeplechase, Stellar Track, and Submarine Commander. It's important to distinguish the Tele-Games brand from Telegames, the company that later produced Atari 2600 cartridges.</p>
